# Landlord_Tenant
App for landlord tenant communication.
Final/Complete version of project available in 'master' branch.

Project Idea: Tenant/Landlord Communication App

This app is meant to be an ideal, user friendly communication app for landlords and tenants. 
In many places it isn’t necessarily the easiest thing to have proper communication with a landlord as a tenant 
and vice versa. Using this application, tenants will be able to report maintenance issues, send complaints or 
safety reminders, pay bills/get reminders about rent, as well as other helpful tasks such as lease renewal, and utility reminders. 
There also will be an emergency contact page for both the landlord and tenant. Landlords will also be able to communicate 
with the tenants, and verify requests as well as send their own custom reminders.
The premise is on an account based system with one landlord and multiple tenants. They each have essentially their 
own UI based on the account. The accounts will possess separate activities that intend to fulfill each requirement of the app.
Since this system is designed to operate on multiple phones, Firebase was going to be used as a database to store 
information such as forms, reminders, complaints etc. When a request is put in by a tenant, the landlord will receive 
the notification and can then mark that they’ve seen it. It will also allow the landlord to reply with a time and 
date of repair, in the case of maintenance issues. The tenant will be able to pay the landlord for their monthly 
bills (this can be later implemented using any banking API). Reminders can be built in, such as the rent reminder by
the landlord and the utilities by the tenant. These types of reminders can be set to go automatically. Landlords can 
also send custom reminders to the tenants, and it will be immediately sent to them and then they can verify they have seen it.
All in all, it is meant to be an easy to use and helpful application to get a better system of communication from landlords and tenants.
